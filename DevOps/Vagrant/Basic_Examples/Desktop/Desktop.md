# Desktop #

The provisioning script for the Desktop VM requires a file named ```repo_ip.txt``` which contains the name or IP of the 
repository and database server (meaning they are expected to be on the same machine).  While this can refer to any 
existing repository, the intended use is to use the ```repo_ip.txt``` file generated by the provisioning script in the 
 Repository Server examples.

Typical steps:

1. Provision the Repository Server VM, which will generate the ```repo_ip.txt``` file.
2. Copy the ```repo_ip.txt``` file into the folder of the Desktop folder you wish to use.
3. Provision the Desktop VM.  It will find the Repository server based on the contents of the ```repo_ip.txt``` file.

As noted elsewhere, the Desktop server VMs that are created in these examples are meant for testing and development; 
they are not meant for production use.
