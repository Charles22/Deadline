This is an example of how to find what versions of software are installed
on your nodes in a Windows environment. It queries the registry for those
installed applications (in this example's case, V-Ray) and returns the
versions available

If you have problems, send an e-mail to support@thinkboxsoftware.com
or go over to the forums. Lots of helpful folks over there.
