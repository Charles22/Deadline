Example of how to calculate on the fly, the jobs stats object for each
completed job and then print the completed job's Peak RAM Usage.

To run this script, just copy this guy somewhere and call it using
DeadlineCommand's ExecuteScript command like so:

C:\Program Files\Thinkbox\Deadline7\bin\DeadlineCommand -ExecuteScript PeakRamUsage.py
