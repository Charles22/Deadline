# Docker #

In this section we provide information to promote the understanding of running Deadline components in 
[Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/).

## Prerequisites ###

### Linux ###

* Only Docker itself is needed.

### Windows and OSX ###

* [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox) is required for Windows and OSX, which includes 
[Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

These examples assume you have a basic understanding of using Docker and the Docker Quickstart Terminal.  If you are 
new to Docker it's strongly recommended that you work through the 
[Get Started Tutorial](https://www.docker.com/products/docker) for your platform.

## Basic Dockerfiles ##

The [Basic Dockerfiles](BasicDockerfiles) folder provides a set of simple Dockerfiles for various 
combinations of base images and Deadline versions.  If you are new to Docker containers, this is a good place to start. 

## Advanced Examples ##

The [Advanced Examples](AdvancedExamples) folder provides information on more advanced concepts like init systems 
for containers and using network shares.
