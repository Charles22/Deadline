This is an example of how you can pull the Slave's current state as the power
management code would consider it. It's mostly helpful for showing how to pull
Slave information from the Deadline API, and what possible running states the
Slave might have.

To run this script, just copy it somewhere and call it using DeadlineCommand's
ExecuteScript command like so:

C:\Program Files\Thinkbox\Deadline6\bin\DeadlineCommand ExecuteScript GetSlaveState.py
