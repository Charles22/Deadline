# Custom #

This corresponds to the same 'custom' folder you'll find in your Repository.

It's where site-specific scripts should live in your pipeline, so if you've
customized a plugin or built your very own event plugin, it should be living
in "[*repo*]/custom/[*something*]". We're following the same convention here to
keep things organized, so feel free to download something and drop it into
your farm.
