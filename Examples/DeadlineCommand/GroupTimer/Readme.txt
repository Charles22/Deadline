This is an example of how you can configure Deadline Slave information
programatically from DeadlineCommand at specific times of day. You'll need to
have it run periodically as a scheduled task or a cron job.

To run this script, just copy this guy somewhere and call it using
DeadlineCommand's ExecuteScript command like so:

C:\Program Files\Thinkbox\Deadline6\bin\DeadlineCommand ExecuteScript GroupTimer.py

As usual, if you have questions, problems, or comments, send them over to
support@thinkboxsoftware.com. Feel free to blame Edwin in the subject
