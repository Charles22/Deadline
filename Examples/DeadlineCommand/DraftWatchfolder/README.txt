This a python based watchfolder script. If you tell it a folder to watch, a folder to put output into, and a Draft script to run on the file that was added.

The includeded codecconvert.py is a simple Draft script for converting to H264

This a pure python script, so run it like any other script with: python watchfolder.py

I've tried to include links to the documentation in the code to make things as clear as possible.
