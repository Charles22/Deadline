This is an example on how to create a script for retrieving information from the tasks panel in the monitor. Specifcally the script retrieves the slave machine names of the selected tasks.

To use, drop the script in C:\DeadlineRepository7\scripts\Tasks. Open up Deadline Monitor, select the desired tasks, right click, go to scripts and select GetSelectedTaskNames. 

The slave machine names that rendered each task will be printed to the console.
