JobCleanup.py
=================

DISCLAIMER:
This slave event plugin could do dangerous things like delete all of your jobs.

This script replicates what is available in "Repository Settings" -> "Jobs" -> "Cleanup". The benefit here is that it will clean up *any* job (as opposed to just completed ones) and can be modified to suite you needs.

If you need advice on how to modify things, feel free to e-mail us at support@thinkboxsoftware.com.
