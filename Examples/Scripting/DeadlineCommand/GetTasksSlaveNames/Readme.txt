This example is used to pull information from the commandline using deadlinecommand. Specifically the script cycles through each job and prints the Slave Machine Name for each task in a job.

To run this script, copy it somewhere and then call it using DeadlineCommand's ExecuteScript Command. Navigate to C:\Program Files\Thinkbox\Deadline7\bin\ and run the following command.

deadlinecommand ExecuteScript <path>/GetTasksSlaveName.py
