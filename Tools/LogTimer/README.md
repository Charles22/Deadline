logtimer.py - View delays in Deadline logs
-----

This simple Python script allows you to concentrate on which parts of the log show a delay between lines. This is useful for when you have a Slave log where jobs with a single concurrent task took longer than you'd expected.

It's very simple, and will have trouble with job reports at the moment. I'm committing this now as it is useful for me, and I hope it will be useful for you as well. Pull requests welcome!
