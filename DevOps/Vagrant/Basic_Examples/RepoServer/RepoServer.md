# Repo Server #

The provisioning script for the Repository server will write out a ```repo_ip.txt``` file which simply contains the IP 
address of the VM.  This file can be copied into the folder for the Desktop or Render node Vagrant examples so that 
they will find the Repository server during provisioning.

As noted elsewhere, the Repository server VMs that are created in these examples are meant for testing and development; 
they are not meant for production use.
