In this section we provide information to promote the understanding of running Deadline components in 
[Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/).

## Prerequisites ###
[Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox) is required for Windows or Mac, which includes 
[Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/). For Linux, only Docker itself is needed. 

These examples assume you have a basic understanding of using Docker and the Docker Quickstart Terminal.  If you are 
new to Docker it's strongly recommended that you work through the 
[Get Started Tutorial](https://www.docker.com/products/docker) for your platform.

## Basic Dockerfiles ##

The [Basic Dockerfiles](BasicDockerfiles/README.md) section provides a set of simple Dockerfiles for various 
combinations of base images and Deadline versions.  If you are new to Docker containers, this is a good place to start. 

## Advanced Examples ##

The [Advanced Examples](AdvancedExamples.md) section provides information on more advanced concepts like init systems 
for containers and using network shares.
